# Online-code-editor


1-->Project Overview

Objective:- 

Create an online code editor for HTML, CSS and JS code snippets using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.


Project Context

Online code-editor is a tool that resides on a remote server and is accessible via browsers. Some online code editors have basic features like syntax highlighting or code completion similar to text editors while others are like complete IDEs.
For any developer, be it amateur or professional, often the liberty of using a local code editor may be unavailable. As online code-editors are fast, efficient and greatly popular, it is a familiar tool among developers. If you have used one, ever wondered how it can be made? This module will guide you through the process that can be followed to build your own code-editor for HTML, CSS and JS code snippets. Implementing the project will add an immense value to your profile.

This project is, a new idea for intermediates and a refreshing hobby project for professionals. It involves the basic use of all of HTML, CSS and JS languages. Reason for following this tech-stack is that these languages are easy to use and are also fast in terms of execution time



Product Stages:-

We can segregate the product architecture based on tools used:
HTML, CSS - Site user interface (site’s skeleton layout)
JQuery - Site’s core functionality
GitHub - To host the web application

High-Level Approach:-

Creating the structural aspect of code-editor using HTML, CSS (i.e. without any animations and features)   
Implementation of core functionalities and other small features using JQuery, a JavaScript library    
Publish to GitHub and finally host your deployed code-editor     


Applications:-

Some of the applications of online code editors are:    
For online interviews/hiring: With online code editors, you can do interviews with ease. It helps to see candidates’ approach towards solutions and work with code.     
Prototyping: You can validate your ideas and get instant feedback from users as sharing and collaboration options are available and saves you from the pain of local setup.

2 --> Prototyping   
validate the idea by doing a low level implementation (Proof of Concept) of the components involved in the project.

This helps you to:   
 *more clarity around the unknowns.
 *a better understanding of the stages involved in the project.
 *various aspects of the terms mentioned in the preceding sections, like why to use JQuery instead of JavaScript (ES6), XML vs HTML, why use HTML5/CSS3 and not the other versions, etc.    

Requirements:- 
Ideally this is a simple JQuery-based app. So start by creating one by first downloading jQuery  
Then create an appropriate project folder with essential files. 
 
        --------------------------------------------------------******--------------------------------------------------------------

 3 -->basic site layout 
 
In this milestone, the basic structure of the code-editor is built (excluding the core functionality) using HTML.   
   
 *Requirements:- 

The main components to be created are HTML, CSS, JS buttons (render upon toggling) and a ‘run’ button. This can be done using simple lists in HTML.      
Wrap all the components and containers in appropriate classes and divisions which will then be used for references in styling. This step must be done in the future too, when the need arises.      
Create (three) containers in which the HTML, CSS, JS code snippets will be inputted by the user. For this use the textarea HTML tag.    
Finally wrap the ‘run’ button with the iframe element (can be done later). iframe element is used to render the desired output as a webpage within a webpage.  

-------------------------------------------------*****************************************----------------------------------------------

4--> core-functionality of the code-editor
 The basic features to be implemented are the following:

HTML, CSS, JS buttons should open/close it’s corresponding container for users to easily input and handle respective code inputs.
A ‘run’ button that will execute the code on toggle.
A result window which will show the corresponding output after the code is run. Implement the logic for this part using the iframe element.

5-->website live  

 by using GitHub pages we are hosting our editor live.
