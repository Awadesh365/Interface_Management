1-->Project Overview

Objective:- 

Create an online code editor for HTML, CSS and JS code snippets using HTML, CSS and JQuery(js).


Project Context

Online code-editor is a tool that resides on a remote server and is accessible via browsers. Some online code editors have basic features like syntax highlighting or code completion similar to text editors while others are like complete IDEs.
For any developer, be it amateur or professional, often the liberty of using a local code editor may be unavailable. As online code-editors are fast, efficient and greatly popular, it is a familiar tool among developers. If you have used one, ever wondered how it can be made? This module will guide you through the process that can be followed to build your own code-editor for HTML, CSS and JS code snippets. Implementing the project will add an immense value to your profile.

This project is, a new idea for intermediates and a refreshing hobby project for professionals. It involves the basic use of all of HTML, CSS and JS languages. Reason for following this tech-stack is that these languages are easy to use and are also fast in terms of execution time



Product Stages:-

We can segregate the product architecture based on tools used:
HTML, CSS - Site user interface (site’s skeleton layout)

High-Level Approach:-

Creating the structural aspect of code-editor using HTML, CSS (i.e. without any animations and features)   
Implementation of core functionalities and other small features using JQuery, a JavaScript library    
Publish to GitHub and finally host your deployed code-editor     


Applications:-

Some of the applications of online code editors are:    
For online interviews/hiring: With online code editors, you can do interviews with ease. It helps to see candidates’ approach towards solutions and work with code.     
Prototyping: You can validate your ideas and get instant feedback from users as sharing and collaboration options are available and saves you from the pain of local setup.
