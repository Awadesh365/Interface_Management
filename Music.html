            Music

        Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.[1][2]
        It is <br>
        one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common
        elements such <br>
        as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and
        articulation), <br>
        dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the
        "color" <br>
        of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these
        elements. <br>
        Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there
        are <br>
        solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces
        that <br>
        combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική, mousiké, '(art) of the Muses'.[3] <br>
        <br>
        In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the
        creation of <br>
        works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music,
        and the <br>
        aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music in two parts: melodies, as
        tones <br>
        ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the
        spheres" and <br>
        "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However,
        <br>
        20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise,
        only <br>
        sound."[4]
        <br>
        The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social
        context. <br>
        Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music",
        including <br>
        Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[5] early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s[6] and hardcore punk
        in the <br>
        1980s.[7] There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written
        for <br>
        religious ceremonies, and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions—such as
        <br>
        Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s—through to spontaneously played improvisational music such
        as jazz, <br>
        and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries. <br>
        <br>
        Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e.g.,
        <br>
        alternative country and country pop are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and <br>
        relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally <br>
        <br>
        controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. <br>
        Within <br>
        the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, or as an auditory art. Music may be played or <br>
        sung <br>
        and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music <br>
        theater show <br>
        or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player, smartphone or as film score <br>
        or TV <br>
        show. <br>

        In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious
        rituals, rite <br>
        of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities <br>
        ranging <br>
        from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make <br>
        music <br>
        as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer. The <br>
        music <br>
        industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), <br>
        individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and <br>
        conductors), <br>
        individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and <br>
        individuals who sell recordings, sheet music, and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been <br>
        performed, <br>
        music critics, music journalists, and music scholars may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance. <br>
